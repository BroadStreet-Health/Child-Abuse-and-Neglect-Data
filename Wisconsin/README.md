Data Source:
Data for Wisconsin was available on the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families website. The data was found within “Child Abuse and Neglect Report” under “Child Protective Services Reports” for the years 2016-2020. Within this report contains a section for “Total Maltreatment Allegations by Maltreatment Type and Maltreatment Finding, by County” where each county provides the relevant data. The data captures total number values per county for Neglect, Physical Abuse, Sexual Abuse, and Emotional Abuse.

Data Collection & Input:
Data is collected weekly for each county in the United States that is reporting any extent of child abuse.
Data is collected as a cumulative count rather than a daily count. Types of abuse are provided comprehensively within yearly reports where cases are to be reported into an entire data set. Numerical cases reported under “substantiated” are data of interest; this indicates the case(s) are confirmed by evidence.
When the county is not listed nor its numerical data, often from lack of collection (e.g. geological effects, data release phases), a “-” is used to denote this. When 0 cases are reported in a category, a 0 is used as the placeholder.
